In this guide, we will go through how to make graphs accessible for people with low vision or blindness.
Using the system, you can understand things like stock price behaviour, see whether a given stock has a price decrease at some point, and also other more finer details. Another popular example nowadays is the ability to understand Coronavirus data, which gets updated on a daily basis, such as daily patient count graphs.
In this guide, you will practice making an accessible graph, with data provided as an example, in 3 stages.
Note: Currently, this guide is intended for Windows users, using your preferred browser and screen reader.

## Stage 1
* [Download the Excel file spreadsheet to your computer](http://accessiblegraphs.org/assets/tutorial_data_en.xlsx)
* Copy the first and the second columns, which consists of 12 rows.

## Stage 2
* To make this data accessible, please visit the link [Builder - Accessible Graphs](https://accessiblegraphs.org/builder/index.html)
* Paste the data in the first edit field of the app using Ctrl + V, or any method you prefer, and then press Tab.
* If the data is copied successfully, your screen reader will report that the data is valid.
* Give a description to the graph, "percentage of rainy days of each month of the year" in our example by pasting the text in the description field.
* From here onwards, you can navigate to the view button to produce the accessible graph.
Note: In this stage, we will skip some more advanced options.

## Stage 3
You should now see an accessible graph such as the one [in this link](https://accessiblegraphs.org/view/index.html?data=0%090%0920%0960%09100%09100%0960%0920%090%090&minValue=0&maxValue=100&instrumentType=synthesizer&ttsName=Google%20US%20English).

### Navigating the graph with a screen reader
* With left and right arrows, you can move between the values found on the Y axis. The data is conveyed using 3 channels - braille, speech and tones.
* For each data element, you can press the spacebar to hear more info.

### Navigating the graph with a braille display
* The left side of the braille display (cells 1 to 29) displays an overview of the graph. This part is static.
* The 30th cell is a kind of separator between the left and the right sides.
* The right side (cells 31 to 40) displays the data element under the cursor in the left side more accurately. You can think of the right side as an area where the data element under the cursor is displayed under a greater magnification level.
