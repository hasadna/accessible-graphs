    <h2>The Accessible Graphs project</h2>
    <p>
        The Accessible Graphs project <a href="https://accessiblegraphs.org">accessiblegraphs.org</a> aims to help
        people with blindness access data such as graphs and other complex numerical data.
    </p>
    <p>
        In todayâ€™s world, data accessibility is a basic human right.
    </p>
    <p>
        Data is often visualized using graphs, charts, heatmaps etc, which are inaccessible to blind people. We aim to
        provide the accessible alternative - a multi-sensory interface to the data. This interface uses sound and touch,
        in addition to the visual channel, as a means to convey the same underlying data.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our hope is that this project will unlock high-quality employment opportunities for blind people in fields such
        as Data Science, Finance, Scientific Research, Education and others.
