# The Accessible Graphs project
The Accessible Graphs project ([accessiblegraphs.org](https://accessiblegraphs.org)) aims to create accessible graphs for blind people. These graphs allow blind people to understand complex numerical, just like sighted people can with visual graphs.

## Why are we doing this?
In todayâ€™s world, we view data accessibility is a basic human right.

Data is often visualized using graphs, charts, heatmaps etc, which are inaccessible to blind people. We aim to provide the accessible alternative - a multi-sensory interface to the data. This interface uses sound and touch, in addition to the visual channel, as a means to convey the same underlying data.

Our hope is that this project will unlock employment opportunities for blind people in high-quality fields such as Finance, Data Science, Scientific Research, Education and others.
