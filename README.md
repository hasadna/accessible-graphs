# The Sensory Interface project
The Sensory Interface project ([sensoryinterface.com](https://sensoryinterface.com)) aims to help people with blindness access data such as graphs and other complex numerical data.

In todayâ€™s world, data accessibility is a basic human right.

Data is often visualized using graphs, charts, heatmaps etc, which are inaccessible to blind people. We aim to provide the accessible alternative - a multi-sensory interface to the data. This interface uses sound and touch, in addition to the visual channel, as a means to convey the same underlying data.

Our hope is that this project will unlock high-quality employment opportunities for blind people in fields such as Data Science, Finance, Scientific Research, Education and others.
